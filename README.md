# 03-password-generate
In this assigment I was given the html and css of a web page that when complete would generate a random password for the user. I was tasked with adding javascript to the file in which it would prompt the user with criteria questions in order to generate a proper password. After the question are complete the user should be able to click the generate button and a random password should appear.
